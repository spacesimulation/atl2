                <p class="leading-relaxed">Canola oil is not toxic and provides many health benefits, Ellen Liskov, 
                  a registered dietician at Yale University, told USA TODAY.

                  First, canola oil contains the least amount of saturated fat compared to other cooking oils and is 
                  high in monounsaturated fat, which lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, Liskov said. LDL 
                  cholesterol is a buildup of plaque in blood vessels that can increase the risk of heart attack, according to 
                  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
                  
                  Second, canola oil is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, Guy Crosby, associate professor of nutrition at 
                  Harvard University, told USA TODAY in an email. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory substances that lower 
                  the risk of heart failure and stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. 
                  
                  Canola oil is also a good source of vitamins.
                  
                  A 2013 literature review found that, compared to other sources of dietary fat, canola oil increases levels of 
                  vitamin E, which has antioxidant properties that protect against free radicals, which are atoms that cause cell
                 damage in the body, according to the Mayo Clinic. Angela Dansby, a spokesperson for the U.S. Canola Association,
                 told USA TODAY in an email that canola oil also contains vitamin K, which helps maintain normal blood flow. Consuming 
                 too much of any food has disadvantages though, Crosby said. And canola oil can be easily oxidized, a process that occurs 
                 when healthy compounds in oil degrade due to chemical reactions, according to New Zealand's Plant and Food Research 
                 Institute. 

                  "(This) may be a concern if (canola oil) is used in large amounts in deep fat fryers," Crosby said.
                  The steps in the Facebook post that describe how canola oil is purportedly processed are misleading, Dansby said.

                  Canola seeds each contain about 45% oil, according to the Canola Council. After seeds are manually pressed for oil
                 extraction, a small amount of chemical solvent called hexane is used to remove about 20% of the remaining oil, Dansby 
                 said. High levels of hexane can be "neurotoxic," according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But refined vegetable
                 oils may only contain close to "0.8 milligrams of residual hexane per kilogram of oil" once extraction is complete, Crosby 
                 told the Harvard School of Public Health.

                 "There appears to be very little reason for concern about the trace levels of hexane in canola oil," Crosby said.

                  Sodium hydroxide and phosphorous acid are used to remove gums and other undesirable compounds in oil, according to Dansby.
                  But sodium hydroxide is only highly caustic or corrosive in high doses, Dr. Christopher Holstege, a medical toxicologist at 
                  the University of Virginia, told USA TODAY. 
                 "If it (canola oil) was highly caustic, it would burn (your skin or your body)," Holstege said. "It doesn't burn because the
                  sodium hydroxide isn't there. These chemicals may be used initially, but then they're removed."

                 To improve the shelf life of canola oil, water and acids may be used to "to remove lipids, gums, free fatty acids and fine
                  meal particles," according to the Canola Council of Canada. This is the opposite of what the post claims. 

                 Actual bleach is not used in the process, either. The term “bleaching” comes from the process of filtering canola oil through
                  a natural clay to remove color pigments, Dansby said.  Steam injection, as labeled in the post, is used to extract heavy
                   crude oil for petroleum, according to Dansby. Steam distillation, a process in which canola oil is heated to a boiling
                    point, is used to remove odors from canola oil through condensation.

                  John Dickerson explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families.
                  23-year-old Francesca Santacroce suddenly found herself parent to her teenage sister, and caregiver to their 
                  mother, an at-home dialysis patient with COVID, after her father was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator.
                  
                  "I literally feel like I'm about to shatter in a million pieces right now," Santacroce told Dickerson. "But - I
                   feel like one wrong move and I'm going to break. And I'm going to fall apart. But I know that I can't. I can't 
                   do that. Because I need to take care of my family right now."
                  
                  Francesca's father died the day after our interview, but early this month, her mother received a kidney 
                  transplant. And in August, Francesca will enter medical school.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Good health is an asset. Good health means soundness of body and mind.
                   It keeps us fit for our work. It keeps us free from diseases. It is the most valuable possession in
                    human life. By maintaining some rules, we can keep good health. To keep good health, one has to eat 
                    a balanced diet, drink clean water, take fresh air, rest properly and take physical exercise regularly.
                     To keep good health one should rise early in the morning and take some physical exercises. To speak the 
                     truth, it is the greatest wealth of all things on earth.

                  We should eat a balanced diet. We should drink clean water and take regular physical exercise. Health is 
                  the sound state of the body as well as of mind. Most people are in our country. So they do not get the food
                   they need for good health. If people do not take a balanced diet, they often suffer from various diseases. 
                   A healthy man must have soundness of mind as well as the soundness of the body. The rich and educated people 
                   are not conscious of the rules of good health. They think that costly food is good for health. As a result,
                    most of the people suffer from various complexities.
                  
                  The importance of keeping good health can not be described in words. It is said that good health is the 
                  source of all happiness. Public awareness should be increased about good health. However, life without good 
                  health is boring and unbearable. To be healthy, one must grow up in a balanced way. A healthy man is really 
                  lucky because he can do his duties properly and become successful in life. By keeping a simple and carefree life 
                  one can lead a happy life. Therefore, we should keep good health to lead a healthy, comfortable and diseases free life.</p>
